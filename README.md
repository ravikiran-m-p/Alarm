# Alaram


in the output screen while entering the button only alrams satrts as the problems is 
:

  browsers dont allow music or sound to play by itself 
  without the user doing something first 
  like a click or tap its a rule for privacy and spam control 
  so the alarm cant just start the song on its own 
  you need at least one user action 
  to let the page play sounds 
  after that first click it can play sounds automatically
